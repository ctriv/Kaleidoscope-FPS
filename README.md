# Kaleidoscope-FPS

This is a plugin for [Kaleidoscope][fw], that adds a First-Person_shooter-specific
LED effect, along with a way to toggle to a fps layer, and apply the effect.

This plugin is a modified copy of the Kaleidoscope-Numlock plugin

 [fw]: https://github.com/keyboardio/Kaleidoscope

It is still in a work-in-progress state.  Do not expect things to work.
